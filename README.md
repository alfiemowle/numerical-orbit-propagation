# Numerical Orbit Propagation in Python

This repository contains a self-contained demonstration of numerically propagating a spacecraft orbit using Python. It sets up orbital initial conditions, defines the equations of motion with optional third-body perturbation, integrates the system using SciPy’s `solve_ivp`, and visualises the resulting trajectory in 2D, 3D, and as an interactive Plotly animation.

This project is included as an example of my work in:
- Orbital mechanics
- ODE integration and numerical methods
- Scientific Python workflow
- 3D visualisation and animation

Note: All notebook output has been cleared to keep the file size small on GitHub.
